# AI-Based Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-Based Recommendation System** developed as part of the **Infosys Internship Program**.  
The objective of the project is to build an intelligent system that provides personalized recommendations using different Machine Learning techniques.

The system supports **Content-Based**, **Collaborative-Based**, and **Hybrid Recommendation** approaches and is integrated with a **Streamlit-based web interface** for interactive user experience.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand and implement recommendation system algorithms  
- To apply Machine Learning concepts to real-world use cases  
- To build an end-to-end AI project with a user-friendly interface  
- To gain hands-on experience in model integration and deployment readiness

## 🧠 Recommendation Techniques Used

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends items similar to the user’s selected item
- Uses item features and similarity measures

### 2. Collaborative Filtering
- Recommends items based on user behavior and preferences
- Utilizes interaction patterns between users and items

### 3. Hybrid Recommendation System
- Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering
- Provides more accurate and balanced recommendations

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Streamlit (Web Application Framework)  
- Git & GitHub
